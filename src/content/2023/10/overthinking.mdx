This site took me almost two years to make.

Not because it's overly complicated, but because I overly complicated it.

One of the worst parts about being a developer is working on your own site. Every time I wanted to write, I would realize my site wasn't done. Next thing I knew, I was working on figuring out the site, rather than writing something.

I would get stuck in a loop of overthinking and overcomplicating.

Time to be done. Time to ship. Time to write.

Here goes nothing. Or something.
