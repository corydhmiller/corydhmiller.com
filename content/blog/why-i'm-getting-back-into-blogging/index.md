Recently I decided to get back into the blogging scene, as you can well tell from visiting this site.

It's really simple. The site runs on Gatsby and the theme is based on the starter blog "theme". I've futzed around with the settings a bit, styled things a bit more to my liking, but there's nothing really unique or stunning about the site in general.

It's just what I needed.

In the past I've opted to roll WordPress and get a custom theme set up because hey, a blog is a blog, so why not use something like WordPress?

Using a static-site generator like Gatsby is simple, but it does one thing really well: **it stops me from overthinking.**

WordPress is fine for what it does, but it has become an absolute monolith. Wrestling the mighty CMS into something that is actually usuable takes a fair amount of time at the onset, and I just wanted to get started.

I had started uploading a few posts on <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev.to</a>, which is a great service and all, but I really miss the good ol' days of people hosting their own blogs. There's something magical about it.

I'm also pretty fed up with social media these days. I have a minor presence on Twitter and a bit of YouTube, but I've already ditched Facebook and most other social media handles. I just don't care to be there anymore. A blog, however...it can be my space. My world. My thoughts. All in one place.

I'll be utilizing this blog to write little thoughts on my development journey, and hopefully do some teaching as I go. I haven't spent a lot of time writing on how I code or development in general, and I think I'd like to do more of that, if nothing but to just document my journey.

It also cannot be denied that writing about development helps make you a better developer, or at least has the capacity to. If I'm blogging about tips or tricks or whatnot, I'd better know what I'm talking about.

Anyways. Just a little bit of an update. I don't have a set cadence or schedule yet, though I'd like to get back into the daily habit again.

See you in the next one.
