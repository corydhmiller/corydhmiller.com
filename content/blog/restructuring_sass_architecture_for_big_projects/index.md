I have a love-hate relationship with development architecture. I really enjoy problem solving and having things be orderly, but I often find myself struggling to make a final decision and go with it.

Do I go with a 7-1 structure? 5-1? Import all files into a single file? Import folder files into a single file, then import all those into a single file?

**And what the heck do I name them?!**

Ultimately what I have found is to find something that works for you and your team and go with it. Decision paralysis is not uncommon for developers, but it is among the top reasons for delays in the process.

I'm currently in the process of restructuring our marketing site's SASS architecture. Here's the process I went through to turn our monolithic multi-folder 200+ `@import` lined SASS into a cohesive and user-friendly result.
