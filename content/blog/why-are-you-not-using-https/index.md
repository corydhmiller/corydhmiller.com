It's 2019 and I still see websites not utilizing HTTPS on their websites. 

I see websites with the _option_ for HTTPS, but they don't force HTTPS.

Look, I get it. SSL certificates used to be a bit more out of reach for the common web developer.

It's easier now. You can get a Let's Encrypt certificate pretty much anywhere, any time. You can easily pop a few lines of code and force HTTPS. Hell, most web hosts can do this _for you_.

Why? [Because your site is not secure with http](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/).

Get a certificate and get your site secure.

You don't want to be the person who regrets not doing it sooner.
